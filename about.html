                <p>
                    Nepal is a country of strong contrasts: high mountains and low plains,
                    quiet villages and busy cities, ancient temples and modern life. This
                    page gives a short, clear overview.

                <h2>Country Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, located between India and China.
                    The country is best known for the Himalayan range, which includes Mount Everest,
                    the world’s highest peak. Even with its small area, Nepal has a wide variety
                    of landscapes and climates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many ethnic groups live in Nepal, each with its own language, festivals and
                    traditions. Hinduism and Buddhism are the main religions, and their influence
                    can be seen in architecture, art and daily life.

            <h2>Short History Snapshot</h2>
            <p>
                For centuries, the Kathmandu Valley was home to several small kingdoms, which built
                impressive palaces and temples. In the 18th century, King Prithvi Narayan Shah
                unified many of these areas into one kingdom, which later became modern Nepal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nepal remained independent during the colonial period but maintained close ties
                with neighbours. In the 20th and 21st century, the country went through big political
                changes, moving from monarchy towards a federal democratic republic.

                <p>
                    Daily life in Nepal is closely connected to religion and tradition. Temples,
                    stupas and monasteries are common meeting places, and many families take part
                    in festivals throughout the year.

                <p>
                    Traditional Nepali food is simple but filling, often based on rice, lentils and
                    seasonal vegetables. Street stalls and small family restaurants serve both local
                    dishes and international options.
